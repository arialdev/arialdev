			Hello! My name is √Ålvaro Rivas, also known on social media as <span class="font-bold"
				>@arialdev</span
			>, and I'm a Spanish software engineer. Actually I studied two engineerings: software
			engineering and computer science engineering.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a strong passion for what I like to call "horizontal learning." While it is valuable to
			become an expert in a particular area, I find great joy in exploring various domains, much
			like trying different flavors at an ice cream parlor. As a result, I consider myself to have a
			well-rounded, full-stack profile. However, I do have my preferences, with <span
				class="font-bold font-monospace">JavaScript</span
			> and <span class="font-bold font-monospace">TypeScript</span> being my primary programming languages.
